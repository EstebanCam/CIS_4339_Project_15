Before running, make sure you have npm installed all required dependencies.

To run, go into the terminal and type in 'npm run devstart'.

This will then run the freshserver.js file.

In regards to the server.js file, it is the 'old' freshserver.js file.
I wanted to 'start over' in a sense when i was writing the server code,
hence the new file.
